# Data Directory

This directory contains the MIPS instruction data for the Interactive 5-Stage Pipelined RISC Processor Simulation.

## 📁 Files
- **program.js** - Contains the MIPS instruction data used by the simulation

## 📊 Content
The program.js file contains:
- Predefined MIPS instructions for the simulation
- Instruction metadata (opcodes, registers, descriptions)
- Hazard examples for visualization
- Pipeline timing information

## 🚀 Usage
This data file is loaded by simulator.js to provide the MIPS program for execution in the pipeline.
